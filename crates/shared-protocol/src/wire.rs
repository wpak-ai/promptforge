//! The OpenAI-shaped request and response bodies the gateway speaks.
//!
//! These are the gateway's own view of the wire contract. The executor defines
//! its own copies against the same JSON; the two are deliberately not shared,
//! because JSON is the contract and each side's struct is shaped by its role.
//! In v0 the message and choice payloads are kept as opaque JSON so everything
//! the gateway does not route passes through untouched.
//!
//! WIRE-005: the `object` discriminators are fixed `&'static str` literals
//! (`"list"`, `"model"`), so they are already closed.
//!
//! `gateway_warning` is a gateway-specific extension on the OpenAI response
//! shape: when an emulated tool dialect recovers from a malformed tool fence,
//! the affected choice's message carries the reason under `gateway_warning`
//! next to its emptied `content`. Downstream serde ignores the unknown field.
