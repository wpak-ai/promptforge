The credential-holding inference gateway for PromptForge. It serves an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API that routes chat completions to configured backends, holds every credential, manages a model catalog, runs a built-in web search tool, and optionally spawns local `llama-server` processes for GGUF models. Nothing above it holds a vendor key. A key rotation touches one file on one host.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install gateway
```

## Usage

```bash
promptforge-gateway serve gateway.toml --profile main
```

The config path comes from the positional argument or the `PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_CONFIG` environment variable (the CLI argument wins). With neither set, the gateway searches beside the executable, then the working directory, then the user profile's `.promptforge` directory; when no `gateway.toml` exists, first run writes a default there - loopback on an OS-assigned port, a fresh random bearer key, `trust_loopback = true` so same-machine callers need no key (with the shared-machine caveat and the `trust_loopback = false` opt-out noted in the file), the recommended STT pair unless the installer declined it - and boots from it. The profile comes from `--profile NAME`, the `PROMPTFORGE_PROFILE` environment variable, or the sibling state file, in that precedence; with none set, startup refuses and lists the profiles the config defines. The generated default writes its state file selecting `default`, so a bare first boot needs no flags.

Configure endpoints, models, and credentials in the TOML catalog. The gateway accepts `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/embeddings`, and `POST /v1/rerank`, synthesizes speech at `POST /v1/audio/speech` with the voice catalog at `GET /v1/audio/voices`, serves a model catalog at `GET /v1/models`, and, with the default-on `stt` feature, serves streaming dictation at `/stt`, capability discovery at `GET /stt/capability`, and OpenAI-compatible multipart transcription at `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`.

Embedding hosts use the library API instead of the binary: `spawn` starts the gateway on a dedicated thread with its own runtime and blocks until the listener is bound, returning a `GatewayHandle` that carries the bound URL and a graceful-shutdown switch (`url()`, `shutdown()`, `join()`).

## System tray

On Windows the binary's default main loop is the system tray: a hidden-window win32 message loop owns the main thread while serving stays on the gateway thread. The menu carries a disabled status line on top (gateway state plus served models and declared VRAM, refreshed on a timer from in-process state), then **Workshop** (launches `promptforge-workshop.exe` when the installer laid it beside the gateway; disabled on a Gateway-only install), **Settings** (opens the config SPA in the browser through the one-time `/auth?key=` handoff, as does double-clicking the icon), **Launch at Login** (a check item whose state is the HKCU Run key entry `PromptForgeGateway`, never local config), and **Quit** last, which fires the in-process shutdown signal directly. `--no-tray` keeps the headless Ctrl-C loop for servers and CI; the autostart entry's `"<exe>" serve --login` command line marks login launches, which never open a browser. `--browser` opens the Settings page in the default browser once the listener is bound - the installer's first run uses it. On macOS the NSApplication run loop owns the main thread, the icon is a template glyph, and Launch at Login registers through `SMAppService` when the gateway is its bundle's principal executable. On Linux the tray is a pure StatusNotifierItem over the session D-Bus (ksni; no GTK, no libappindicator): icon clicks carry no events there, so the menu is the only path, and Launch at Login writes `~/.config/autostart/promptforge-gateway.desktop` (a user-deleted entry is never resurrected). A desktop with no StatusNotifierWatcher - stock GNOME without the AppIndicator extension - keeps serving trayless, posts one first-run notification naming the Settings URL, and registers the tray automatically when a watcher appears. Two CLI affordances serve tray-less environments: `--print-url` prints the Settings handoff URL to stdout once bound and then serves headless, and a second `promptforge-gateway` launch while one is running never boots a duplicate - it hands off before any bind attempt, opening the running gateway's Settings page (printing its URL under `--print-url`, exiting quietly under `--login`). Platforms without a backend fall back to the headless loop with a warning.

See the [PromptForge User Guide](https://cppalliance.github.io/promptforge/) for full documentation.

## Profiles

One `gateway.toml` holds the entire catalog, opened by `config-version = 2`: global sections once (`[server]`, `[local]`, `[tools]`, `[[endpoint]]`, `[[dominion]]`), remote models as `[[model]]`, local models as `[[local_model]]`, and speech-to-text models as `[[stt_model]]`. Profiles are named checklists over that catalog:

```toml
[[profile]]
name = "work"
models = ["gpt-5", "qwen3-local", "whisper-base-en", "whisper-small-en"]

[[profile]]
name = "travel"
models = ["qwen3-local"]
```

The active profile filters the catalog before validation and spawn: checked remote models route, checked local models spawn `llama-server` children, checked STT models load into the gateway-owned transcription engine. Membership is the entire definition; profiles carry no per-field overrides.

The active profile is not a config key. It lives in a sibling state file - `gateway.toml` maps to `gateway.state.toml` - with one canonical key:

```toml
active_profile = "work"
```

Every profile is validated at load: names are unique and legal, every listed model exists in the catalog, and each profile's local and STT subset is checked against dominion VRAM budgets, so a live switch can never land on an invalid profile. A state file naming a profile that no longer exists is a startup error naming the stale value.

Switching runs from the already-loaded catalog through `POST /admin/switch-profile`, streaming its stages (`loading-profile`, `downloading-models` when the profile names local models, `stopping-models` when there are old children to stop, `starting-models`, one terminal event) over SSE. Inference is never blocked by a download or a spawn: the new local models' weights stage into the cache while the old children keep serving (or, on a cold boot or from a remote-only profile, after the new profile's remote models are already published), then in-flight inference requests get a bounded drain - up to 30 seconds - before stragglers are cancelled and the old children stop; the new subset then spawns, and the commit swaps the full routing table in and persists the choice to the state file. While a local model is downloading or spawning after the cut-over, a request for it gets `503` with code `model_loading` and `Retry-After: 5`, `GET /admin/status` lists it under `loading_models`, and `GET /v1/models` lists only routable models. The Config UI stages `active_profile` as pending state like any other edit, so the switch lands atomically on Apply.

Switches, boot provisioning, and model unloads run as commands on a serialized, debounced queue with per-command cancellation. `GET /admin/status` reports the queue (the active command's name, progress fraction, and start time, plus the pending commands) and one readiness entry per capability endpoint (`ready` when a loaded model serves it, `provisioning` when a command is loading its configured models). `POST /admin/queue/cancel` fires the active command's cancellation token; `POST /admin/queue/cancel-pending` drops a waiting command by index.

The pre-2 layout is a hard break with no compat loader: a config carrying an `include` key, a top-level `models` allowlist, or the old `[workshop.voice]` model keys, a missing or wrong `config-version`, or a sibling `profiles/` directory fails to load with an error naming the file, key, and line, plus the replacement to use.

## The `[server]` section

The boot config's `[server]` section is required; `bind` and `api_key` have no defaults and accept `${VAR}` interpolation from the process environment.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bind` | required | Socket address the gateway listener binds. |
| `api_key` | required | Shared bearer key. Every request from a non-loopback peer must present it, and a presented key is always checked. |
| `trust_loopback` | `true` | Admit a loopback peer that presents no credential at all, on every route including the admin surface. On a shared machine this lets any other OS account on the same host use the gateway, including reading upstream API keys from the admin config surface; set `trust_loopback = false` (or bind off loopback) to require the bearer key from every caller. |

Loopback trust is deliberately narrow. It applies only when no `Authorization` header was sent - a presented-but-wrong bearer is still 401, even from loopback - and only when the request's fetch metadata allows ambient access: no `Sec-Fetch-Site` header (curl, the SDK, the workshop, any non-browser client) or `same-origin`/`none` (the config SPA on its own origin, a typed URL). A browser page on another origin sends `cross-site` and is refused, so loopback trust does not reopen the CSRF hole the bearer requirement closed; the Host allowlist below still closes DNS rebinding. A request without a peer address fails closed and needs the key. The SDK's `GatewayClient::from_env` reads the same rule: `PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is optional when `PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_URL` is loopback, required otherwise.

The section is process-owned: a pending edit that changes it is promoted to disk on Apply but takes effect only on restart, reported as `restart_required` in the apply response.

## The `[local]` section

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cache_dir` | `~/.promptforge` | Root directory for GGUF files and the pinned `llama-server` installs. |
| `llama_backend` | `"auto"` | Which `llama-server` build to download on Windows x86-64: `auto` picks from the host's GPUs (Blackwell gets the PromptForge CUDA build, any other NVIDIA GPU the upstream CUDA 13 build, anything else Vulkan); `cuda-blackwell`, `cuda`, and `vulkan` force the row. Consulted only on Windows x86-64. |
| `llama_server_path` | none | Explicit `llama-server` executable path, skipping the managed download entirely. |

The `llama-server` executable resolves in a fixed order: `llama_server_path` from the config, then the `PROMPTFORGE_LLAMA_SERVER` environment variable, then the managed download under the cache directory. Both CUDA builds ship their runtime DLLs, so the host needs only the NVIDIA driver. When a download fails and an older install is already in the cache, the gateway uses the cached one and logs a warning rather than failing to start.

## Feature flags

Four feature flags exist:

- `local` (default) - compiles in gateway-owned local inference via the `gateway-local` crate: GGUF provisioning, managed `llama-server` children, the blob cache behind the `/v1/cache` routes, the `GET /admin/orphans` listing of cache files no loaded `[[local_model]]` entry references (sizes from the filesystem, digests only from cache sidecars - multi-gigabyte blobs are never re-hashed), the `GET /admin/model-info?path=` GGUF-header readout of a cache file's architecture, layer count, and parameter count (the `path` must stay inside the artifact cache; only the header is read, never tensor data), and the bearer-authenticated `GET /admin/chat-templates` catalog used by the Config UI. A `--no-default-features` build is headless of local inference: it links neither the archive/extraction stack nor a blocking HTTP client, and it refuses a configuration declaring `[[local_model]]` at startup and on profile switch.
- `web-search` (default) - compiles in the Brave-powered `POST /v1/tools/web_search` tool service via the `gateway-web-search` crate. A `--no-default-features` build omits the route entirely.
- `stt` (default) - compiles in gateway-owned speech-to-text via the `gateway-stt` crate: the transcription engine lifecycle, streaming `/stt` routes, and `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` on the gateway listener. A `--no-default-features` build omits the routes and refuses a configuration declaring `[[stt_model]]` at startup and on profile switch.
- `config-ui` (default) - compiles in the embedded config SPA via the `gateway-config-ui` crate and serves it at `/config/` on the gateway's own port (no second listener); `GET /config` redirects to `/config/`. The routes are loopback-only and carry no bearer auth (the SPA shell holds no secrets); Node/esbuild and `rust-embed` enter the build only with this feature: Node 22 is needed on the build machine for the UI bundle's esbuild step, not for Rust itself, and a `--no-default-features` build needs no Node at all. With the feature, `GET /auth?key=` is the browser handoff onto the surface: it validates the bearer key, sets a session proof derived from it (SHA-256 over a process-lifetime salt and the key, so the cookie never carries the key and a restart or key rotation revokes it) as an HttpOnly `SameSite=Lax` session cookie, and 302-redirects to the key-free `/config/`, which accepts the cookie in place of the `Authorization` header - a tray or shell can open the UI without leaving the key in browser history. Because the cookie is ambient, the cookie path also requires `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` or `none` fetch metadata, which browsers attach and a cross-origin page cannot strip. Regardless of the feature, the admin config endpoints (config read/write, env, pending state, apply/revert, orphans, system, model-info, chat templates, the HF proxy, profile create/delete, reveal) plus `POST /shutdown` and `GET /auth` sit behind the shared loopback wall from the always-on `shared-loopback` crate: a non-loopback peer gets 403 before bearer auth even runs. `POST /shutdown` is the bearer-authed graceful stop - the same drain Ctrl-C drives - answering 202 before the server goes down; the tray's Quit and the shell's Quit-everything call it. And whenever the listener is bound to a loopback address, every route sits behind the wall's second middleware, a host-authority allowlist that refuses with 403 any request whose `Host` is not the bound socket (`127.0.0.1:port`, `[::1]:port`, or `localhost:port`), closing DNS rebinding; a non-loopback bind enforces no allowlist.

The speech runtime itself is a pinned managed download selected for the host at run time. Note the build graph: the default-on `stt` feature's `gateway-stt` crate depends on `workshop-server` (the `/stt` socket attach API), whose build script bundles the workshop UI with esbuild - so default builds need Node 22 even though the gateway serves no workshop pages, and only a `--no-default-features` build drops that requirement. The gateway hosts no workshop UI: the desktop shell embeds the workshop server itself, and a boot config carrying a `[workshop]` section still parses but earns a deprecation warning at startup - its `bind` and `open_browser` settings are inert, while `[workshop.stt]` capture tuning still applies to the STT engine.

### Speech-to-text models

Speech-to-text models are first-class catalog entries, provisioned through the same pinned, digest-verified cache machinery as local chat models and governed by profile membership: transcription is on when the active profile's list contains STT models, off otherwise. A `--no-default-features` build (no `stt` feature) refuses an active profile that selects STT models, same as it refuses `[[local_model]]`.

```toml
[[stt_model]]
name = "whisper-base-en"
role = "interim"
source = "https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.en.bin"
sha256 = "a03779c86df3323075f5e796cb2ce5029f00ec8869eee3fdfb897afe36c6d002"
vram_gb = 1.0
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | required | Catalog name that `[[profile]].models` entries reference. |
| `role` | required | `interim` (the streaming passes while a take records) or `final` (the crystallizing pass at stop). |
| `source` | required | `https` download URL or operator-controlled local path; plaintext `http` is rejected. |
| `sha256` | none | Lowercase hex SHA-256 pin, enforced after download when set. |
| `vram_gb` | required | Estimated VRAM use in gibibytes; counts toward a bound dominion's budget. |
| `dominion` | none | Local dominion that accounts for this model's VRAM. |

A profile may select at most one interim and one final STT model. Interim without final is allowed as a degraded mode: nothing crystallizes mid-take and the final pass falls back to one interim decode at stop. Final without interim is a validation error naming the fix. The config crate ships a digest-pinned recommended pair - `whisper-base-en` (interim) and `whisper-small-en` (final) from the whisper.cpp Hugging Face repo - and the Config UI's **Restore recommended models** button writes both entries into the pending config.

`[workshop.stt]` (optional) configures push-to-talk capture tuning. Model
sources, pins, and interim/final roles live in the global `[[stt_model]]`
entries above; the active profile enables them by catalog name.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `window_seconds` | `15` | Seconds of trailing audio each interim pass transcribes. |
| `interval_ms` | `500` | Milliseconds between interim passes while a take is recording. |
| `vocabulary` | `[]` | Domain terms whisper is biased toward. Empty disables biasing. |

### Speech synthesis models

Speech models are ordinary catalog entries with `kind = "speech"`, routed like any other remote model: they resolve through the same routing table, admit through the same dominion queue, and appear on `GET /v1/models`. Local speech serving is not in this release, so a `[[local_model]]` declaring `kind = "speech"` is a startup error naming the remote alternative.

```toml
[[endpoint]]
id = "together"
protocol = "openai"
base_url = "https://api.together.xyz/v1"
api_key = "${TOGETHER_API_KEY}"

[[model]]
name = "orpheus"
kind = "speech"
description = "Orpheus 3B conversational speech synthesis"
context = 8192
upstream = "canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft"
endpoints = ["together"]
voices = ["tara", "leah", "jess", "leo", "dan", "mia", "zac", "zoe"]
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `chat` | `speech` routes the model to `POST /v1/audio/speech`. |
| `voices` | `[]` | Voice names this model offers. A request naming another voice is refused with `invalid_voice` listing these; an empty list disables the check and lets the backend decide. |

`POST /v1/audio/speech` takes the OpenAI speech body: `model`, `input`, and `voice` are required, and `response_format` (`mp3` default, plus `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, `wav`, `pcm`), `speed` (0.25 to 4.0), `instructions`, and `stream_format` are optional. Unnamed fields pass through to the backend verbatim. `input` is capped at 4096 characters and is never rewritten on the way through: speech models take inline direction from bracketed tags such as `<laugh>` and `<sigh>`, which any escaping would destroy. A caller who names no `response_format` gets `mp3` pinned into the forwarded request rather than the backend's own default, since providers disagree about what that is.

The response is the backend's audio, byte for byte, under the backend's own `Content-Type` and with no `Content-Length`: a synthesized clip has no known length when the headers go out. Because the status and headers are sent before the first audio byte, a synthesis that fails mid-clip cannot be reported as an error envelope; the body ends early instead, so a caller sees a truncated download rather than a short clip that looks complete. Hanging up mid-clip aborts the upstream synthesis and releases the queue slot.

`GET /v1/audio/voices` lists the union of every loaded speech model's voices as `{"id", "name"}` objects. OpenAI has no such endpoint, but the OpenAI-compatible ecosystem converged on it and clients probe for it.

## Local model companions

A chat `[[local_model]]` can declare two companions, each provisioned through the same pinned, digest-verified cache machinery as the main model:

```toml
[[local_model]]
name = "gemma-4"
description = "Gemma 4 E2B instruct with MTP drafting and vision"
source = "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF/resolve/main/gemma-4-E2B-it-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf"
sha256 = "b52f438017efaec5debf1c0d8be690571e212a07c312f1102bbce927258cfc32"
context = 131072

[local_model.speculative]
type = "draft-mtp"
source = "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF/resolve/main/mtp-gemma-4-E2B-it.gguf"
sha256 = "9eba819938efccfd6044f8af84e3bbfddc639a2bcf32ebc36420e6a649191919"
draft_max = 2

[local_model.multimodal_projector]
source = "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF/resolve/main/mmproj-F16.gguf"
sha256 = "140be8d7849741f88c50757d529b84373ee8e27052cc2236855b537f4a8215fa"
```

`[local_model.speculative]` attaches a multi-token-prediction drafter: the child launches with `--spec-draft-model`, `--spec-type draft-mtp`, and `--spec-draft-n-max` (`draft_max`, bounded to `1..=16`). `[local_model.multimodal_projector]` attaches a vision projector (`--mmproj`) so the model accepts image inputs, and the catalog advertises `images = true` for it. Companion sources follow the main source's rules: an `https` URL requires a `sha256` pin, a local path may go unpinned, and plaintext `http` is rejected. Both companions are chat-only and validated at load. The resolved paths live in the child's launch state, so a respawn re-emits the exact verified artifacts, and a model without companions gets the same command line as before companions existed.

### Chat templates

A local chat model's template is chosen at launch with a fixed precedence: an explicit `chat_template_file` path, then `chat_template_file = "builtin:<family>"` (a bundled, versioned template staged into the cache), then a known-override match (the gateway ships a table of known-broken embedded templates, matched by embedded-template content hash first and model id second), then the GGUF's embedded template under the always-present `--jinja` flag. When none of these yields a usable template the launch is refused with an error naming the model and the fix; there is no silent passthrough. The Config UI surfaces this on each local model as a dropdown - Auto, one option per bundled family, or a custom path - with a read-only summary of the effective source, the detected family, and the reason behind the decision.

### Derived client credentials

An unspecified `[server]` bind IP becomes the matching loopback address in the derived client URL (`0.0.0.0` becomes `127.0.0.1`, `[::]` becomes `[::1]`), so a same-host consumer always gets a dialable URL.

### Process-owned sections

`[server]` is process-owned. Apply promotes edits to it to disk and answers `restart_required: true`; the running process keeps its booted listener and STT capture settings until restart. A profile switch never changes it, because profiles are checklists over the model catalog and carry no sections.
